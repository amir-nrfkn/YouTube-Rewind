# YouTube-Rewind

Every year Spotify comes out with Wrapped, showing each user fun stats like which artist they listened to the most or what genre of music they kept returning to that year.
Inspired by this, I decided to create a something similar using my YouTube data.
I used Google Takeout to download a copy of my YouTube search, watch, and comments data.
Finally I can see which YouTube channel I watch the most and look at cool month-over-month trends!

Since this is the first time I've done this, I decided to go beyond the current year of 2022, and also look at data from previous years all the way back to 2019.
